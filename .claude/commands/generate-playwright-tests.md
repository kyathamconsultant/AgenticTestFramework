Feature to automate: $ARGUMENTS

## Phase 1 – Exploration (Playwright Planner Agent)

Use the Playwright Planner agent with the MCP browser to:
1. Load .claude/skills/playwright-test-automation/SKILL.md — apply locator rules throughout
2. Load .claude/skills/application-domain/SKILL.md — apply domain knowledge to test scenarios
3. Navigate to the application and log in using provided credentials
4. Navigate to the feature page for: $ARGUMENTS
5. Explore the feature completely — all form fields, dropdowns, buttons, flows
6. Explore both the success state and error/validation states
7. Produce a structured test plan:
   - All test scenarios for: $ARGUMENTS
   - Step-by-step actions per scenario
   - Expected outcomes per scenario
   - All selectors observed in the live DOM during exploration

## Phase 2 – Script Generation (Playwright Generator Agent)

Using the test plan and live selectors from Phase 1:
8. Generate a Page Object Model class for the feature
9. Generate a complete Playwright TypeScript spec file covering all scenarios

10. Apply CLAUDE.md financial policies to every assertion (no generic checks)
11. Add screenshot-on-failure afterEach hook
12. Externalize all credentials, amounts, and account values to a JSON test data file
